<h2 align = "center"> üå± Plantcycle - An all in one app to look after my houseplants üå± </h2>

## Project Summary

‚òòÔ∏è I would like to create an application that will allow me to collect and store data on the condition of each of my plants, with additional features (such as a weather app) in a style that is simple and user friendly.

## Why this subject?

üå≤ I love to look after plants! My room is a small but growing jungle of various tropical plants, most of which I have grown from gifted cuttings.

üåø Watering and checking the condition of each plant weekly takes a lot of time. Also, I do not have a record of how my plants are doing throughout the year, and what their optimal water/fertiliser conditions may be. I want to gather data to work towards understanding this process. As well, I would like to display the current weather conditions in my local area to make the platform multi purpose for myself.

## The plan

### Back-end

<details>
<summary>#### Setting up my file structure, installing dependencies </summary>
<br>
- Use an ES6 NPX Generator to create the file structure for my project (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-esmodules)
  - Check that the import syntax is definitely ES6
  - Create .gitignore file - ignore node_modules
- Instal dependencies: pg, dot/env
- Instal dev dependencies: prettier, eslint
- Create a .prettierrc.json file to start using prettier
- Ensure the type is set to module in package.json
- Create a new cloud-based PostGres database on Heroku
- Link up:
  - Store my Heroku credentials in an env file
    - Hide this env file, use gitignore
  - Create a database folder, containing a config.js and index.js file
  - Use syntax 'process.env' to export values from env file
  - Inside of index file, create a pool referencing these values defined in config
  - Check scripts - change them to include "node -r dotenv/config your_script.js" so they run dot/env

#### Creating new table / populating a table in Heroku database

- Create a JS file with a hardcoded array of 3 plants and their respective values
- Create a scripts folder inside of the database folder
  - Create a createTable file which will create a new SQL table on the Heroku database.
    - Create a script in the package.json that will execute this file
    - Check to see if it works
  - Create a populateTable file which will create a new SQL table on the Heroku database.
    - Create a script in the package.json that will execute this file
    - Check to see if it works

#### Creating models for CRUD requests

- Create a models folder
- Create JS file containing functions for : for selecting data (return all, return by id, return by word close to name)
- Export each function

#### Use the models to make requests to the database

- Import each of the model functions
- Create requests in app.js for: creating (.post), reading (.get), updating (.put) and deleting (.delete)
- Test each request using Postman

### Front-end

TBC

### Questions for myself

- Why is the server listening on ... message not appearing in my terminal?
