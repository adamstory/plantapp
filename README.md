<h2 align = "center"> Plantcycle - An all in one app to look after my houseplants  </h2>

## Why this subject?

I love to look after plants! My room is a small but growing jungle of various tropical plants, most of which I have grown from gifted cuttings. 

Watering and checking the condition of each plant weekly takes a lot of time. Also, I do not have a record of how my plants are doing throughout the year, and what their optimal water/fertiliser conditions may be. I want to gather data to work towards understanding this process. As well, I would like to display the current weather conditions in my local area to make the platform multi purpose. 

In summary, I would like to create an application that will allow me to collect and store data on the condition of each of my plants, with additional features (such as a weather app) in a style that is simple and user friendly.
